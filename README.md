# todo-app

This is a solution to the [Todo app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/todo-app-Su1_KokOW).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list (In developing)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [VUE](https://vuejs.org) - JS Framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - Frontend Tooling
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) - State Management Library

### What I learned

Practiced the positioning of elements on the page. I also tried using the state management library (Vuex). And of course I learned how to create a double theme on the site.

### Continued development

In the future, I'm going to add drag and drop.
